# Assigment 6

Improve Car Leasing System by adding Java Swing GUI capabilities.

- The Main Menu should have **three** JButtons in total.
- The *first button* should be used to **create a new Lease**.
- The *second button* should be used to **Display all Leases** that have been created so far.
- *Third button* should **exit and terminate the application**.
- Lastly, the first two buttons should have a **darker background** and the text labels on them should be visibly **bigger and bolder**.
- After the `Lease a Car` button is pressed, a new screen for creating a new lease should pop up.
- If the user presses on the `Continue` button, they should **go back** to the *Main Menu*.
- If the user presses on the `Cancel` button, the application should **terminate**.
- If the user presses on the `Display All Leases` button, a window should pop up and display **all Leases** created.
